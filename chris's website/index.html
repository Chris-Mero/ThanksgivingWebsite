        <li>Masks????? Are you weak, forget them!</li>
        <li>How many people do you invite? Well how many people do you know.</li>
        <li>Be sure to be kind and invite over the sick, their families probably abandoned them because of the Mythical Corona.</li>
        <li>Sneeze on people's food, thus allowing them to experience what you got to taste.</li>
        <li>Finally, go door to door and leave people your half eaten leftovers. You really wanna SPREAD the cheer.</li>
